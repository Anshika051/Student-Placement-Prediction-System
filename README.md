# Student-Placement-Prediction-System
The Student Placement Prediction System is trained on Random Forest Classifier which is a machine learning algorithm. It predicts the odds of a student being placed and provides a placement prediction probability as well based on the relevant features.

1. The "Prediction.ipynb" file contains the code for the model training.
2. "collegePlacement.csv" dataset has been used to train, test and evaluate the model, which is also available on Kaggle.
3. The model provides an accuracy of 88% while making prediction for the student placement based on features like CGPA, Backlogs, Internships, Stream, etc.
4. The file "app.py" is built on the streamlit framework in Python and allows the users to make predictions based on different features.
